If the user wants to run one of the notebooks, they will first need to download the corresponding dataset.

The datasets which are used by the notebooks (in the notebooks folder) can be found in Google Drive: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1zI9HNGgVM0mUt1nTWWoVNQsJh2mPHPAJ?usp=drive_link

Alternatively, at the beginning of each notebook we provide a URL to the original source of the data, from where the user can also download the dataset.
