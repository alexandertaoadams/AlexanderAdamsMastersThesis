The datasets which are used by the notebooks in the notebooks folder are stored in Google Drive: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1zI9HNGgVM0mUt1nTWWoVNQsJh2mPHPAJ?usp=drive_link

Alternatively, at the beginning of each notebook we provide a URL to the original source of the data, from where the user can also download the dataset.

Before running a notebook, the user needs to download the corresponding dataset and save them to their google drive.
